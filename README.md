# Golden Ore Bank
Our website is a new banking platform called Golden Ore Bank. We primarily used HTML/CSS to design the layout of our website but in order to make our website more responsive and accessible, we decided to include JavaScript libraries such as jQuery/jQuery mobile. The purpose of our website is to allow users to track their finances such as their bank/checquing account, debit/credit card(s), borrowing accounts such as a line of credit (LOC), and investment accounts such as a TFSA. 

How it works is you start with a simple login screen which takes you to the homepage. The homepage displays a list of the user's accounts, account types, account balances, and other relevant information. If you click on any of the listed accounts, it will take you to the respective transactions page where it shows a list of transactions for that account. The investments page displays a list of investment accounts with their balances, as well as the recent transaction history. The transfer funds page allows the user to make Interac E-Transfers to other people such as friends/family. They just simply enter the name of the recipient of the funds and specify the amount to be transferred, and just before they can send the money, they have to enter their password as a basic security measure to prevent unauthorized E-Transfers. 

We also have a page that acts as a live chat where if the user has any questions, they can type their message in the chat window and then click on the submit button. There is also a cancel button to clear the input field.

Currently, this is just a static website with static/hardcoded information. In the future, we may decide to make it more dynamic by implementing some JavaScript functionality as well as a backend to handle the information the user enters.
